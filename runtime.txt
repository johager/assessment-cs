The Javascript push() function has time complexity of O(1). It only has to add en element to the end of the array which is a simple, one-step process.

The Javascript unshift() function has time complexity of O(n). When it adds an element ot the beginning of the array, it has to shift all other elements one index to the right, an increasingly-complicated process.
